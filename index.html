            <h1>Happy Birthday Siem :3</h1>
            <p>
                I want to say that Happy birthday sayo Siem and more birthdays to come, sa special na araw na ito sana maging happy ka at enjoy mo. Pero para sakin, araw-araw nagiging masaya at special kasama ka kahit chat-chat lng. Lalo na yung araw na nakilala kita. At pasensya na sa mga minsan naiiwasan kita, pero hindi mo po kasalanan yun, you are just too precious and valuable. And I think you're so perfect from anything that I could just lose everything. And always remember na I will always support you and be happy sa iyong mga desires at dreams, I will wait for you because I want to be committed with you. I just want to say and let you know how much I freakin love everything about you, and sometimes it just hurts when you say na pangit ka or anything when it's not true :< And if people deny's and rejects you, I am here to feel your pain and insecurities. I will always be here for you, even when I'm while asleep. And I know it's your birthday today, and somehow I just feel so grateful for everything because of you.
                It's like you were sent by God, and it's beautiful. You're kind, amazing, funny, well you know what funny is its insane cuz it is rare to be funny, I know your parents would be so proud and happy to have both of you, I wish for your health, happiness. And if something goes wrong, it's okay to vent to me or if ayaw mo its okey then but I want to make you sure that you are important and nothing else, I would write a thousand chapters, hundreds of songs, and millions of reason why I love you. I have more words to say but it will be better the next days heheheh, But no words can explain how much I love you Siem. I LOVE YOU SIEM HAPPI BIRTHDAY ❤️❤️❤️❤️
